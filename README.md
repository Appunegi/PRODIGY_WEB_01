# PRODIGY_WEB_01
Task completed: PRODIGY_WD_01-Responsive landing page I have successfully completed my first task as a Web Development intern at Prodigy Infotech

In this task, I created a web page for negi bakery with:

-A fixed navigation bar that changes color and shadow when you scroll.

-A hover effect on menu items.

-A scrollable page with some welcome content.

what i learned:

HTML: structure a webpage with nav and sections. CSS: Style a fixed navbar, add hover effects, transitions. JavaScriptâ€‹: Detect scroll, dynamically update styles. web design: Build an interactive, clean, real-world layout.

personal reflection:

this is also my first internship and my first task in web development.

through this task i also learned:

-how to use GitHub

-how to post and share work on LinkedIn

-why do we use platforms like GitHub and LinkedIn in a professional setting

Although i had some basic knowledge about these tools before, this internship helped me gain a much clearer understanding of their importance and practical use.

thankyou

i would like to thank Prodigy Infotech for giving me this opportunity to learn and grow.

I'm looking forward to completing more task and improving my skills!
